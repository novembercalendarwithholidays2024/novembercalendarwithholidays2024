Our calendars on our iPhones are no exception. They help us keep track of our busy lives, but sometimes we need to delete events. In this article, we will go over the steps to delete events on your iPhone&#8217;s calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Step-by-Step Guide<\/h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Open the Calendar App<\/h3>\n<p>The first step to deleting an event on your iPhone&#8217;s calendar is to open the calendar app. This is usually located on the home screen of your iPhone. Once you have opened the app, you should see a calendar with all of your events listed.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Locate the Event<\/h3>\n<p>The next step is to locate the event that you want to delete. You can do this by scrolling through the calendar or by using the search function at the top of the screen. Once you have found the event, click on it to open it.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Click &#8220;Edit&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Once the event is open, you should see an &#8220;Edit&#8221; button at the top right-hand corner of the screen. Click on this button to make changes to the event.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Delete the Event<\/h3>\n<p>After clicking &#8220;Edit&#8221;, you should see a red &#8220;Delete Event&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen. Click on this button to delete the event from your calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Can I recover a deleted event?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, you can recover a deleted event within 30 days of deletion. To do this, go to the &#8220;Recently Deleted&#8221; folder in your calendar app and select the event you want to recover. Then, click &#8220;Recover&#8221; to restore the event to your calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Will deleting an event delete it from all my devices?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, deleting an event on your iPhone&#8217;s calendar will delete it from all devices that are synced with your iCloud account. This includes your iPad, Macbook, and any other devices that use the same iCloud account.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Deleting events on your iPhone&#8217;s calendar is a simple process that can help you keep your schedule organized. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily delete events that are no longer relevant to you. Remember that deleted events can be recovered within 30 days, and that deleting an event on one device will delete it from all synced devices.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Add &amp; Delete Events from Calendars on iPhone &amp; iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.osxdaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/how-to-add-delete-events-calendar-iphone-2.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>osxdaily.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to create, edit, and delete calendar events on your iPhone or iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/xlarge\/public\/field\/image\/2014\/06\/delete_calendar_event_iphone_ipad_howto2.jpg?itok=NNC4gW6T\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.imore.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete Calendar Events on iPhone or iPad iGeeksBlog\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.igeeksblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Delete-Subscribed-Calendars-on-iPhone.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.igeeksblog.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\u0411\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u043e\u0431\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c How to add Facebook Events to iPhone calendar (and\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media.idownloadblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/delete-calendar-ios.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>yarsokoll.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete Calendar Spam from iPhone\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.trickyways.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/word-image-1.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.trickyways.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Delete Calendar Events on iPhone or iPad iGeeksBlog\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.igeeksblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Delete-Calendar-Events-on-iPhone-or-iPad.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.igeeksblog.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Add &amp; Delete Events from Calendars on iPhone &amp; iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/cdn.osxdaily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/how-to-add-delete-events-calendar-iphone-768x574.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>osxdaily.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to delete events from Google Calendar? \u2022 TechBriefly\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/techbriefly.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/gc11.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>techbriefly.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to Delete Calendar Events on iPhone or iPad iGeeksBlog from www.igeeksblog.com Introduction As we rely more and more on technology, our devices become an extension of&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w7.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/516"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w7.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w7.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w7.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w7.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=516"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w7.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/516\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w7.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=516"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
