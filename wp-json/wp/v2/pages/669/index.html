This calendar includes important dates such as the start and end of each semester, holidays, and breaks. In this article, we will discuss the details of the calendar and how it will impact students and faculty members at the college.<\/p>\n<h2>Important Dates<\/h2>\n<p>The fall semester at Stonehill College will begin on August 28, 2024, and end on December 13, 2024. The spring semester will start on January 22, 2025, and end on May 9, 2025. There will also be a summer session from May 27, 2025, to June 25, 2025, and a second summer session from June 30, 2025, to July 30, 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Some important dates to note include Labor Day, which falls on September 2, 2024, and Thanksgiving break, which runs from November 27, 2024, to November 30, 2024. The winter break will run from December 14, 2024, to January 21, 2025. Spring break will be from March 14, 2025, to March 22, 2025, and there will be no classes on Memorial Day, which falls on May 26, 2025.<\/p>\n<h2>Impact on Students<\/h2>\n<p>The academic calendar for 2024-25 will have a significant impact on students at Stonehill College. With the fall semester starting earlier than usual, students will have more time to complete their coursework before the winter break. However, the shorter winter break may be challenging for students who need additional time to rest and recharge before the start of the spring semester.<\/p>\n<p>The longer spring break may provide students with an opportunity to travel or catch up on coursework, but it may also disrupt academic momentum. Additionally, the summer session may be beneficial for students who want to complete additional coursework or accelerate their degree program. However, it may not be ideal for students who want to take a break from academic work during the summer months.<\/p>\n<h2>Impact on Faculty<\/h2>\n<p>The academic calendar for 2024-25 will also impact faculty members at Stonehill College. With the earlier start of the fall semester, faculty members may need to adjust their syllabi and course schedules to ensure that they can cover all of the required material before the end of the semester. The shorter winter break may also be challenging for faculty members who need time to prepare for the spring semester.<\/p>\n<p>The longer spring break may provide faculty members with an opportunity to conduct research or catch up on administrative tasks, but it may also disrupt their academic momentum. Additionally, the summer session may provide faculty members with an opportunity to teach additional courses or conduct research, but it may also limit their ability to take a break from academic work during the summer months.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<p>Q: Will the academic calendar for 2024-25 impact graduation dates?<\/p>\n<p>A: No, the academic calendar for 2024-25 will not impact graduation dates. Graduation dates are set in advance and are not impacted by changes to the academic calendar.<\/p>\n<p>Q: Will there be any changes to the academic calendar during the academic year 2024-25?<\/p>\n<p>A: It is possible that there may be changes to the academic calendar during the academic year 2024-25. However, any changes would be communicated to students and faculty members in advance.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The academic calendar for 2024-25 at Stonehill College includes important dates such as the start and end of each semester, holidays, and breaks. This calendar will have a significant impact on students and faculty members at the college. Students will have more time to complete their coursework before the winter break, but the shorter break may be challenging. Faculty members may need to adjust their syllabi and course schedules to ensure that they can cover all of the required material before the end of the semester.
