With multiple devices and different calendars, it can be a challenge to ensure that all our events and appointments are synced and up-to-date. In this article, we\u2019ll explore how to sync your iCalendar with Google Calendar in 2024, so you can stay organized and on top of your schedule no matter where you are or what device you\u2019re using. <\/p>\n<h2>What is iCalendar?<\/h2>\n<p> iCalendar, also known as ICS, is a file format used for sharing calendar information between different devices and applications. It is widely used by Apple devices, such as Macs, iPhones, and iPads, as well as Microsoft Outlook and other calendar applications. <\/p>\n<h2>Why Sync Your iCalendar with Google Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p> Google Calendar is a popular online calendar application used by millions of people around the world. By syncing your iCalendar with Google Calendar, you can access your schedule from anywhere, on any device, and share it with others.

To do this, open the Calendar app on your device and select the calendar you want to export. Then, go to File > Export > Export. Choose a location to save the file, and click Export. <\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Import Your iCalendar into Google Calendar<\/h3>\n<p> Once you have exported your iCalendar, you can import it into Google Calendar. To do this, open Google Calendar and go to Settings > Import &#038; Export. Click on Select file from your computer, and choose the iCalendar file you just exported. Then, select the calendar you want to import the events into, and click Import. <\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Set Up Automatic Syncing<\/h3>\n<p> To ensure that your calendars stay synced, you can set up automatic syncing between your iCalendar and Google Calendar. To do this, go to Settings > Calendars, and select the calendar you want to sync. Then, click on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner, and select Settings and sharing.
