As we enter the year 2023, it&#8217;s important to start preparing for the upcoming tax return calendar for 2024. In this article, we&#8217;ll cover everything you need to know to stay on track with your tax obligations and avoid any penalties or fines. <\/p>\n<h3>What is the Income Tax Return Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> The income tax return calendar is a schedule of deadlines and due dates for filing your income tax returns. It&#8217;s important to keep track of these dates to avoid any late filing penalties or interest charges. The IRS releases the calendar each year, outlining when tax returns are due for different types of taxpayers. <\/p>\n<h2>Important Dates for 2024<\/h2>\n<h3>When is the Deadline for Filing My Tax Return?<\/h3>\n<p> For most taxpayers, the deadline for filing your tax return is April 15th, 2024. However, if you live in Maine or Massachusetts, the deadline is April 17th, 2024, due to the Patriot&#8217;s Day holiday. If you need more time to file your return, you can request an extension until October 15th, 2024, by filing Form 4868. <\/p>\n<h3>When Do I Need to Pay My Taxes?<\/h3>\n<p> If you owe taxes for the year, the deadline for making your payment is also April 15th, 2024. However, if you&#8217;re self-employed or have other sources of income, you may need to make estimated tax payments throughout the year. The IRS provides a schedule of due dates for estimated tax payments, which can be found on their website. <\/p>\n<h2>Tips for Filing Your Tax Return<\/h2>\n<h3>Should I File My Tax Return Electronically or by Mail?<\/h3>\n<p> The IRS recommends filing your tax return electronically, as it&#8217;s faster and more accurate than filing by mail. You can use tax preparation software or work with a tax professional to file electronically. If you prefer to file by mail, be sure to use certified mail and keep a copy of your return for your records. <\/p>\n<h3>What Documents Do I Need to File My Tax Return?<\/h3>\n<p> To file your tax return, you&#8217;ll need to gather all of your income and deduction documents for the year. This may include W-2 forms, 1099 forms, receipts for charitable donations, and other records. If you&#8217;re not sure what documents you need, consult with a tax professional or refer to the IRS website. <\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>What Happens If I Miss the Deadline for Filing My Tax Return?<\/h3>\n<p> If you miss the deadline for filing your tax return, you may be subject to late filing penalties and interest charges. The penalty for filing late is typically 5% of your unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that your return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. If you&#8217;re owed a refund, there is no penalty for filing late, but you may lose the opportunity to claim your refund if you wait too long. <\/p>\n<h3>What Happens If I Can&#8217;t Pay My Taxes by the Deadline?<\/h3>\n<p> If you can&#8217;t pay your taxes by the deadline, you may be able to set up a payment plan with the IRS. You can request a payment plan by filing Form 9465, which allows you to pay your taxes over time. Keep in mind that you&#8217;ll still be charged interest on any unpaid balance, so it&#8217;s best to pay as much as you can by the deadline to minimize your interest charges. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> By following the income tax return calendar and staying on top of your tax obligations, you can avoid penalties and fines and keep more of your hard-earned money in your pocket. If you have any questions or concerns about filing your tax return, don&#8217;t hesitate to consult with a tax professional or refer to the IRS website for guidance. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"FREE 9+ Sample Quarterly Calendar Templates in PDF MS Word\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/images.sampletemplates.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/29174757\/Tax-Return-Quarterly-Calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.sampletemplates.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Tax Calculator For FY 202021 [AY 202122] Excel Download\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.apnaplan.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/New-Regime-Income-Tax-Slabs-for-FY-2020-21-AY-2021-22.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.apnaplan.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2020 IRS tax refund calendar coolguides\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/preview.redd.it\/dcs9vqwvidd41.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f0b5ba902e0dfa63dbbcc0514a2d0039b1ae56fe\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.reddit.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Tax Return Filing Know how to file tax return online for\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.jagranimages.com\/images\/newimg\/04072020\/04_07_2020-income_tax_20472981.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.jagrantv.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Personal Tax and simplification of taxation 20202021\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/indiatoday\/images\/bodyeditor\/202002\/new_income_tax_slabs-1200x1149.jpg?RA2r0ErOqnEHAPszFYqp_R3A8vlGK5kS\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>splan.in<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Regarding tax return not received assessment year 2010 11 yet\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.icomplaints.in\/uploads\/regarding-income-tax-5e49c.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.icomplaints.in<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Is it Mandatory for NRI to File Tax Return in India?
