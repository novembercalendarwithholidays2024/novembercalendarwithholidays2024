The Hijri and Gregorian calendars are two widely used calendars in the world. While the Gregorian calendar is widely used in the Western world, the Hijri calendar is used in many Muslim countries. In this article, we will explore the differences between the two calendars and how they impact our daily lives in the year 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Hijri Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The Hijri calendar, also known as the Islamic calendar, is a lunar calendar that is based on the cycles of the moon. It consists of 12 months, each of which has 29 or 30 days. The start of each month is determined by the sighting of the new moon. The first month of the Hijri calendar is Muharram, and the last month is Dhu al-Hijjah, which is the month of the Hajj pilgrimage.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Why is the Hijri calendar important?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer: The Hijri calendar is important to Muslims as it is used to determine the dates of religious events such as Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Gregorian Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The Gregorian calendar, also known as the Western or Christian calendar, is a solar calendar that is based on the Earth&#8217;s orbit around the sun. It consists of 12 months, with each month having 28, 30, or 31 days. The start of each year in the Gregorian calendar is January 1st and the last month is December.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Why is the Gregorian calendar widely used?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer: The Gregorian calendar is widely used because it is the internationally accepted civil calendar and is used for business, politics, and other purposes.<\/p>\n<h2>Differences Between the Hijri and Gregorian Calendars<\/h2>\n<p>There are several differences between the Hijri and Gregorian calendars. The main difference is in the way they determine the start of each month. The Hijri calendar is based on the sighting of the new moon, while the Gregorian calendar is based on the Earth&#8217;s orbit around the sun. Another difference is the number of days in each month. The Hijri calendar has 29 or 30 days in each month, while the Gregorian calendar has 28, 30, or 31 days in each month.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Why do the months of the Hijri calendar have different numbers of days?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer: The months of the Hijri calendar have different numbers of days because they are based on the cycles of the moon, which are not the same length as the solar year.<\/p>\n<h2>Hijri and Gregorian Calendar in 2024<\/h2>\n<p>In the year 2024, the Hijri calendar will start on August 31st, 2023, and end on August 19th, 2024. The Gregorian calendar, on the other hand, will start on January 1st, 2024, and end on December 31st, 2024. This means that the two calendars will have different dates for the same day. For example, January 1st, 2024, in the Gregorian calendar will be equivalent to Muharram 7th, 1445, in the Hijri calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: How do you convert dates between the Hijri and Gregorian calendars?<\/h3>\n<p>Answer: There are several online converters available that can convert dates between the two calendars. You can also use a conversion formula to calculate the date manually.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Hijri and Gregorian calendars are important tools for keeping track of time and scheduling events. While they have several differences, they both serve their respective purposes. In 2024, the two calendars will have different dates for the same day, which can cause confusion for people who use both calendars. It is important to understand the differences between the two calendars in order to avoid confusion and plan events accordingly.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"El Marefah\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-_dnN3oDIAvI\/Tta8fh1FIlI\/AAAAAAAAD3E\/gol6yzEGg_A\/s1600\/Gregorian-Hijri-Calendar-for-1433.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>elmarefah.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Islamic Calendar 2019 I Hijri Calendar 1440 One Platform For Digital\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.digitallycredible.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Hijri-Calendar-2019-1-850x850.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.digitallycredible.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Hijri And Gregorian Calendar 1441 2020 for Android APK Download\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/image.winudf.com\/v2\/image1\/Y2FsZW5kYXIubmV3eWVhci5oaWpyaS5HcmVnb3JpYW5fc2NyZWVuXzNfMTU2NDgzOTY0OF8wOTI\/screen-2.jpg?fakeurl=1&amp;type=.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>apkpure.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Gregorian Hijri Calendar 2024 (14451446) in United States\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.salatok.com\/modules\/date-converter\/calendars\/image\/gregorian-hijri-calendar-2024-en.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.salatok.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"14411442 Hijri Calendar and Gregorian Calendar Year 2020.
