Other events to look out for include the Governor&#8217;s Ball Music Festival, the Brooklyn Hip Hop Festival, and the Jazz Age Lawn Party.<\/p>\n<h3>How can I find out about upcoming concerts?<\/h3>\n<p>The best way to stay up to date on upcoming concerts is to follow your favorite artists on social media. They&#8217;ll often post about upcoming shows and ticket sales. You can also sign up for email newsletters from venues and ticket sellers. Another great resource is websites like Songkick and Bandsintown, which allow you to track your favorite artists and get alerts when they&#8217;re coming to town.<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of the best venues to see live music in New York?<\/h3>\n<p>New York City has no shortage of great music venues, from small clubs to massive arenas. Some of the most iconic include Madison Square Garden, the Barclays Center, and the Apollo Theater.
