The Ethiopian calendar has 13 months, with 12 months having 30 days each and the last month having 5 or 6 days depending on whether it is a leap year or not. The calendar is based on the Julian calendar and is approximately 7 years and 8 months behind the Gregorian calendar. This means that while the rest of the world is celebrating the start of 2024, Ethiopians are still in the year 2016 according to their calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>What Year is it in Ethiopia in 2024?<\/h2>\n<p>In 2024, Ethiopians will be in the year 2016 according to their calendar. This is because the Ethiopian calendar is 7 years and 8 months behind the Gregorian calendar. The Ethiopian New Year falls on September 11 or 12, depending on whether it is a leap year or not. In 2024, the Ethiopian New Year will be celebrated on September 12.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Does Ethiopia Have its Own Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>Ethiopia has its own calendar because it has a long history of independence and was never colonized by Europeans. The Ethiopian calendar has its roots in the ancient Coptic calendar, which was used in Egypt and Ethiopia. It was further developed by Ethiopian astronomers and is now unique to Ethiopia.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does the Ethiopian Calendar Work?<\/h2>\n<p>The Ethiopian calendar has 13 months. The first 12 months have 30 days each and the last month has 5 or 6 days depending on whether it is a leap year or not. Leap years occur every 4 years, just like in the Gregorian calendar. However, in the Ethiopian calendar, the leap year is calculated differently. Instead of adding an extra day in February, a whole month is added at the end of the year.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Ethiopian New Year?<\/h2>\n<p>The Ethiopian New Year is called Enkutatash, which means &#8220;gift of jewels&#8221; in Amharic. It falls on September 11 or 12, depending on whether it is a leap year or not. The holiday is celebrated with feasting, dancing, and singing. It is also a time for forgiveness and reconciliation, as people seek to put the past behind them and start anew.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are Some Other Holidays in the Ethiopian Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>Aside from Enkutatash, there are many other holidays in the Ethiopian calendar. Some of the most important ones include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timkat &#8211; a celebration of the baptism of Jesus Christ<\/li>\n<li>Meskel &#8211; a celebration of the finding of the True Cross by Empress Helena<\/li>\n<li>Easter &#8211; celebrated by Ethiopian Orthodox Christians<\/li>\n<li>Christmas &#8211; celebrated on January 7th by Ethiopian Orthodox Christians<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Ethiopian calendar is a unique and important part of Ethiopian culture. While the rest of the world is celebrating the start of 2024, Ethiopians will be in the year 2016 according to their calendar. The Ethiopian New Year falls on September 11 or 12, depending on whether it is a leap year or not. Celebrations are an important part of Ethiopian culture, and holidays like Enkutatash, Timkat, Meskel, Easter, and Christmas are eagerly anticipated and celebrated by Ethiopians all over the world.<\/p>\n<h3>Question and Answer:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Q:<\/strong> How many months are there in the Ethiopian calendar?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> There are 13 months in the Ethiopian calendar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q:<\/strong> What is the Ethiopian New Year called?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> The Ethiopian New Year is called Enkutatash.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q:<\/strong> What is the difference between a leap year in the Ethiopian calendar and the Gregorian calendar?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> In the Ethiopian calendar, a whole month is added at the end of the year, while in the Gregorian calendar, an extra day is added in February.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Ethiopian Calendar 13 Months Qualads\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.qualads.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/ethiopia-seven-years-behind-gobeyondsg.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.qualads.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Amhara Heritage Society of Minnesota (AHSM) Inauguration Amhara\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.amharamn.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/ethiopian-calendar-2011.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.amharamn.org<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Enoch \u2018The black prophet\u2019 Addis Herald\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.addisherald.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/ethiopian-calendar-1024x585.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.addisherald.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Ethiopian Calendar (\u1240\u1295 \u1218\u1241\u1320\u122a\u12eb) APK 2.3.1.52 for Android Download\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/image.winudf.com\/v2\/image1\/Y29tLnNoYWxvbS5jYWxlbmRhcl9zY3JlZW5fMF8xNTQ2MzU0NzQ0XzAwNQ\/screen-0.jpg?fakeurl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>apkfab.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Ethiopian Calendar Today Date in Ethiopian Calendar 2021\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.ethiopiancalendar.net\/wp-content\/themes\/etcal\/images\/ethiopian-calendar-today.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.ethiopiancalendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Ethiopian Calendar Fotolip\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.fotolip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Ethiopian-Calendar-3.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.fotolip.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Nagle Family Adventures It&#039;s the year 2002 in Ethiopia\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/_a9KYsSRSsQ0\/S-WExri6b0I\/AAAAAAAABAI\/GSO2TKaOPho\/s1600\/ethiopian+calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>naglefamilyadventures.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Ethiopian Calendar 13 Months Qualads\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.qualads.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/ethiopian-calendar-fotolip.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.qualads.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ethiopian Calendar Today Date in Ethiopian Calendar 2021 from www.ethiopiancalendar.net Introduction Ethiopia is one of the few countries in the world that uses its own calendar.
