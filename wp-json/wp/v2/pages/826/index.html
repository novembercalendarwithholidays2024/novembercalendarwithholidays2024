June is a great time to visit the parks, with long days and warm weather. However, it&#8217;s also one of the busiest times of the year, so it&#8217;s important to plan ahead to make the most of your trip.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing to consider when planning your trip is the crowd calendar. Disney World releases a crowd calendar each year, which predicts how busy the parks will be on each day. This can be a valuable tool for planning your trip, as it can help you avoid the busiest days and make the most of the quieter ones.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Crowd Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>The Crowd Calendar is a tool that helps visitors plan their trip to Disney World. It predicts how busy the parks will be on each day, based on factors such as school holidays, special events, and historical attendance patterns. The Crowd Calendar is updated each year, so it&#8217;s important to check the latest version when planning your trip.<\/p>\n<h3>What Should I Expect in June?<\/h3>\n<p>June is one of the busiest months at Disney World, with crowds peaking around the 4th of July holiday. However, crowds can also be heavy throughout the month, as many families take summer vacations during this time. Expect long lines and wait times, especially for popular attractions like the new Star Wars: Galaxy&#8217;s Edge.<\/p>\n<h2>Top Tips for Navigating the Crowds at Disney World<\/h2>\n<p>While the crowds can be overwhelming at Disney World in June, there are some strategies you can use to make the most of your trip:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Arrive Early or Stay Late<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to avoid the crowds is to arrive at the park before it opens, or stay late after it closes. This can give you some extra time to explore the park without the crowds, and can also help you avoid the hottest part of the day.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use FastPass+<\/h3>\n<p>FastPass+ is a free service that allows you to skip the line for select attractions at Disney World. You can book up to three FastPass+ reservations per day, and can use them to skip the line for popular attractions like Space Mountain and Splash Mountain.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Take Advantage of Extra Magic Hours<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re staying at a Disney World resort, you can take advantage of Extra Magic Hours, which allow you to enter the park an hour early or stay late after it closes. This can be a great way to avoid the crowds and get some extra time in the park.<\/p>\n<h2>Insider Info: What You Need to Know Before You Go<\/h2>\n<p>Before you head to Disney World in June, there are a few things you should know:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Book Your Accommodations Early<\/h3>\n<p>June is a popular time to visit Disney World, so it&#8217;s important to book your accommodations early. This can help you get the best prices and ensure that you have a place to stay during your trip.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Bring Sunscreen and Stay Hydrated<\/h3>\n<p>June can be hot and sunny in Florida, so it&#8217;s important to bring sunscreen and stay hydrated. You can bring your own water bottles into the park, and there are also water fountains throughout the park where you can refill them.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Consider a Park Hopper Ticket<\/h3>\n<p>A Park Hopper ticket allows you to visit multiple parks in one day, which can be a great way to avoid the crowds and make the most of your trip. You can use the Park Hopper ticket to hop between parks as needed, and can even return to a park you&#8217;ve already visited later in the day.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>Visiting Disney World in June can be a great experience, but it&#8217;s important to plan ahead and be prepared for the crowds. With the right strategies and insider info, you can make the most of your trip and create memories that will last a lifetime.<\/p>\n<h3>Have more questions about planning your trip to Disney World in June 2024?
