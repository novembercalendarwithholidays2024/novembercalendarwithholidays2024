It is based on the cycles of the moon, unlike the Gregorian calendar which is based on the cycles of the sun. The Islamic calendar consists of 12 months, each lasting either 29 or 30 days. This means that the Islamic year is shorter than the Gregorian year, with each year being approximately 11 days shorter.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is it important?<\/h3>\n<p>The Islamic calendar is important to Muslims because it is used to determine the dates of religious events and observances, such as Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. It also plays a significant role in Islamic history and culture, as many important events and battles in Islamic history occurred during certain months of the Islamic calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the Islamic year 2024?<\/h3>\n<p>The Islamic year 2024 will begin on the evening of August 9th, 2023 and end on the evening of July 27th, 2024. It will be the year 1445 AH (After Hijra) in the Islamic calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>The Months<\/h2>\n<p>The Islamic calendar consists of 12 months, with each month having its own significance and history.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the names of the months?<\/h3>\n<p>The 12 months of the Islamic calendar are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Muharram<\/li>\n<li>Safar<\/li>\n<li>Rabi&#8217; al-Awwal<\/li>\n<li>Rabi&#8217; al-Thani<\/li>\n<li>Jumada al-Awwal<\/li>\n<li>Jumada al-Thani<\/li>\n<li>Rajab<\/li>\n<li>Sha&#8217;ban<\/li>\n<li>Ramadan<\/li>\n<li>Shawwal<\/li>\n<li>Dhu al-Qidah<\/li>\n<li>Dhu al-Hijjah<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What are the significance of the months?<\/h3>\n<p>Each month of the Islamic calendar has its own significance and history.
