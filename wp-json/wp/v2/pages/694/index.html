With the new reservation system, it&#8217;s more important than ever to plan ahead and ensure you have access to your favorite parks. In this article, we&#8217;ll go over everything you need to know about the park pass calendar for Disney World in 2024. <\/p>\n<h2>What is the Park Pass Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p> The park pass calendar is a system put in place by Disney to manage capacity and ensure all guests have a great experience. With the calendar, guests must make a reservation for the park they want to visit on a specific day. This system was put in place in 2020 due to COVID-19, but it has since become a permanent fixture at the parks. <\/p>\n<h3>Why Do I Need to Use the Park Pass Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> If you&#8217;re planning on visiting Disney World in 2024, you&#8217;ll need to use the park pass calendar to ensure you have access to the parks. Without a reservation, you won&#8217;t be able to enter the park. This system helps manage crowds and ensures all guests have a great time. <\/p>\n<h2>When Can I Make Park Pass Reservations?<\/h2>\n<p> Park pass reservations for 2024 will likely open up in late 2023. Keep an eye on the Disney World website for more information. It&#8217;s important to make your reservations as soon as possible to ensure you get the park and day you want. <\/p>\n<h3>What Happens If I Can&#8217;t Get a Park Pass Reservation?<\/h3>\n<p> If you can&#8217;t get a park pass reservation for the park you want, don&#8217;t worry. You can always try again later. Keep checking the park pass calendar as reservations can open up at any time, especially as the date gets closer. You can also try visiting a different park or changing your travel dates. <\/p>\n<h2>What Happens If I Need to Change My Park Pass Reservation?<\/h2>\n<p> If you need to change your park pass reservation, you can do so on the Disney World website or through the My Disney Experience app. Keep in mind that changing your reservation may not always be possible, especially if the park is already at capacity. <\/p>\n<h3>Can I Visit Multiple Parks in One Day?<\/h3>\n<p> With the park pass system, guests are only allowed to visit one park per day. You can&#8217;t hop between parks like you could in the past. However, you can purchase a park hopper ticket that allows you to visit multiple parks on the same day after 2pm. <\/p>\n<h2>What Happens If It Rains?<\/h2>\n<p> If it rains during your park pass reservation, the park will remain open. However, some attractions and experiences may close temporarily. Disney does its best to keep everything open, but safety is their top priority. <\/p>\n<h3>Can I Get a Refund If I Can&#8217;t Use My Park Pass Reservation?<\/h3>\n<p> If you can&#8217;t use your park pass reservation, you may be able to get a refund. However, it depends on the type of ticket you purchased. Check the Disney World website for more information or contact customer service. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> In conclusion, the park pass calendar is an important part of planning your trip to Disney World in 2024. Make sure to book your reservations as soon as possible to ensure you get the park and day you want. And remember, if you can&#8217;t get a reservation, don&#8217;t worry. Keep checking the calendar and try again later. With a little bit of planning, you&#8217;ll have an amazing time at the happiest place on earth. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Walt Disney World Annual Passholders Get More Disney Park Pass\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog-cdn.touringplans.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Disney-Park-Pass-System-Calendar-768x771.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>touringplans.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Walt Disney World Park Pass Availability Refreshed for Annual\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/wdwnt.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/ap-park-pass-calendar-8273231-1200x1092.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>wdwnt.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Walt Disney World Park Pass Calendar Available Into 2024 WDW News Today\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media.wdwnt.com\/2021\/07\/Cinderella-castle-featured-image-hero-magic-kingdom-07212021-3122744-1155x770.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>wdwnt.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Not Having ANY Luck Making Disney World Park Pass Reservations?
